# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will appear in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include unique hashes.\
Your app is then ready for deployment.

Learn more in the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need more customization than the default setup provides, you can `eject` to gain full control over configuration files and dependencies (such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.). 

Most users won't need to use `eject`, as the default setup is suitable for small and medium deployments.
